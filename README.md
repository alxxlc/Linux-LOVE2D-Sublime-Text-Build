Linux-LOVE2D-Sublime-Text-Build
===============================

This is made to build LOVE2D files from within Sublime Text for Linux. This is a very simple file but when I was first starting with LOVE2D, I found no build file for Linux. I have only tested this script in Ubuntu Gnome and on Sublime Text 3. I jhave not put this into the LOVE2D wiki yet because there is only a page for Sublime Text 2, which I have not tested this in. If anyone can test it in ST2 and wants to put it into the wiki, feel free to do so.

To use this, open Sublime Text and go to "Tools" -> "Build System" -> "New Build System...", copy the code from the "Love2D.sublime-build" file in this repository and paste it into the new build system file. Once the build system file is saved, you will be able to run a LOVE2D project by selecting "Love2D" from the "Build System" menu and the pressing crtl+B at any time while a LOVE2D project file is open.

If you have any questions or possible improvements for this, please let me know.

I have just realized that I have now worked harder on this readme file than I did on the actual build file itself.
